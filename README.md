# Optimal-Truck-Load-Planner
Our logistics platform matches shippers with carriers. When a shipper creates a load (shipment), carriers bid on it. A truck has limited weight capacity (e.g., 44,000 lbs) and volume capacity (e.g., 3,000 cubic feet) and can carry multiple compatible orders on the same route (multi-stop milk-run or LTL consolidation).
